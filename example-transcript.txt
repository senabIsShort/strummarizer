Sam: I think we should integrate the chatbot into the main website. 
Jamie: I’m not convinced - we’ve had issues with reliability.
Sam: True, but the latest version uses a more stable backend.
Jamie: Have we tested it under real user conditions?
Sam: Not yet. That’s on the roadmap for next month.
Jamie: Then maybe we hold off integration until those results are in.
Sam: Fair enough. I’ll prepare a status update for the next team meeting.
